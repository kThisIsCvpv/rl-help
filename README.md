Note: Java JRE **will not** work. Java JRE is commonly used by consumers products. Java JDK contains libraries required by developer programs. Building with IntelliJ, the compilation software below, requires the Java JDK 8 software. You can have multiple Java versions on your PC without confliction.

## Software Installation Process

Please install the programs listed in the requirements above **in the order** that they are listed. In every installation process, you are able to just spam on the **[NEXT]** and **[FINISH]** buttons. There is no ad-ware lurking in these development tools; and hopefully never will.
